## WebsitePortfolio
A personal website to showcase my Computer Science accomplishments. 
Deployed to <a href="https://chenaaron.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chenaaron.com</a>

## Motivation
I felt like it would be a nice learning experience to make my own website. I opted out of Website Builders like Wix because I wanted to make custom features.

## Built With
React, Express, AWS EC2, Nginx

## How Its Made
Currently there are 2 versions of my website. 
The first version (/static) has a traditional layout where anyone can browse. 
The second version (/interactive) is more oriented for programmers because it is basically a shell interface. 
Viewers can use basic Unix commands to traverse my portfolio.
Instead of repeating information in the two versions, I have JSON files on the server to distribute content to both versions.
In this manner, I only need to alter a set of JSON files to reflect changes on both versions.
